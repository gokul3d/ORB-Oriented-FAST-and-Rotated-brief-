ORB Feature Matching
Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) algorithm for feature detection and matching in computer vision. ORB is known for its efficiency, speed, and robustness, making it suitable for various applications such as object recognition, tracking, and image stitching.

Contents
orb_feature_matching.py:

Python script showcasing ORB feature detection and matching.
Reads two images, computes ORB keypoints and descriptors, performs feature matching, and visualizes the matches.
Sample Images:

bottle.jpeg and bottle1.jpeg: Sample images used for demonstrating ORB feature matching.
Replace these images with your own for custom experiments.
How to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (cv2, matplotlib).
Run the orb_feature_matching.py script.
Observe the output displaying matched keypoints between the two images.
Script Usage

python orb_feature_matching.py

The output of the script will be an image visualizing the matched keypoints between the provided images (bottle.jpeg and bottle1.jpeg). Adjust parameters or use your own images to explore the capabilities of ORB feature matching.

Feel free to utilize, modify, or contribute to this project for your feature matching applications.
